# Seller Assistant protocol

Seller Assistant is Amazon's AI assistant for seller questions. The connector exposes it as two tools. There is no dedicated "policies" or "compliance" SP-API operation; searching the connector's tools for "program policies" returns nothing, so Seller Assistant is the live source for rule confirmation.

## Tools

**sellerAssistant_sellerAssistantCreate** — submit a question.

| Parameter | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `query` | yes | The seller's message, as stated, max 10,000 chars. Do not rephrase. |
| `entityId` | yes | The seller's MCID. |
| `conversation_id` | no | Omit for a new conversation; pass a prior response's value to continue one. |

Returns `conversation_id`, `interaction_id`, `status: PROCESSING`. It never returns the answer.

**sellerAssistant_sellerAssistantGet** — retrieve the answer.

| Parameter | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| `conversation_id` | yes | From Create. Never fabricate. |
| `interaction_id` | yes | From Create. Never fabricate. |
| `entityId` | yes | The seller's MCID. |

## Classification and call path

Both tools are classified **destructive** in the current connector, including Get, which is a pure poll. `call_read_only_tool` rejects them with "Tool is destructive". Use `call_destructive_tool`. `_meta.humanReview.requiresHumanReview` is `false` for Create ("elicitation not supported"), so no separate human-review step applies beyond the seller having asked the question. Load each schema once with `get_tool_schema` and reuse it.

## Polling cadence

Every poll is a full model round-trip that replays the whole context, so a poll that is certain to return PROCESSING is pure waste. Wait before the first one.

- **Compliance and regulatory questions take 15 to 35 seconds.** First poll at **~15 s**, then every 5 s. Polling immediately after Create burns three or four round-trips on a `PROCESSING` that could not yet have been anything else.
- Simple policy questions complete in one or two polls (under 10 s); for those, first poll at ~5 s.
- Never poll more often than every 2 seconds. Do not give up before 90 seconds.
- After any status other than PROCESSING, do not call Get again for that interaction_id.
- Budget: a well-paced compliance question costs 2 to 4 Get calls. If you are past 6, something is wrong — report it and fall back to the map rather than continuing to poll.

## Status handling

| Status | Meaning | Required action |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| PROCESSING | Not ready | Wait 3–5 s, poll again with the same arguments |
| COMPLETE | Answer in `response` (markdown) | Use it; present verbatim when showing the seller; keep the help-hub links |
| REQUIRES_CONFIRMATION | `confirmation` object with prompt and options | Show prompt and options to the seller, then call `seller_assistant_update` with their choice. If that tool is not discoverable, tell the seller and record the gap with `functional_feedback` |
| STOPPED | Generation cancelled | Conversation still open; seller may send a new message via Create |
| MODERATED | Response withheld | Tell the seller the content could not be provided |
| OUT_OF_SCOPE | Not a Seller Assistant topic | Tell the seller; fall back to the reference map with a caveat |
| FAILED | Error | Tell the seller; they may retry with a new Create |

## Conversation threading

Pass the same `conversation_id` for follow-ups. In practice each follow-up in a thread ("any other requirements?") returns new material rather than repeating, which is a useful way to exhaust a topic. Start a new conversation when the product or topic changes.

## Observed quirks

- **Citations vary.** A general-policies answer carried per-section links; a listing-guardrails answer had every link pointing to the same page (GXPFG3RRZB9WFPJE); the FDA/EPA/CPSC answer carried no links at all. When links are absent, say so and point the seller to Seller Central Help > Product compliance.
- **Encoding artifacts.** Em-dashes and check marks render as `?`. Render sensibly; do not otherwise alter wording.
- **`seller_assistant_update` may not surface** in the connector's tool search even though Get's description references it.
- **Feedback.** Record malformed-request failures, unhelpful answers, or missing tools with `functional_feedback`. Never record 429, 5xx, 401, or 403; those have their own observability.
