# Metrics catalog

A shortcut for mapping a seller's question to the right metric ID. **The live
`analytics_getMetricMetadata` response is the source of truth** — always confirm the ID and
its `businessDefinition` there. If a metric below isn't in the metadata for the seller's
marketplace, pick the closest one that *is*, and tell the seller which you used.

## Domains
- **`Threep_Inventory`** — FBA inventory health, days of supply, restock, inbound.
- **`Threep_Traffic`** — sessions, page views, glance views, featured-offer share.
- **`Threep_Sales`** — ordered units, ordered items, revenue.

> Domain names carry the `Threep_` prefix in `getMetricData` today. Whether they're renamed
> (to `Inventory` / `Traffic` / `Sales`) for external use is an open decision that may change
> before GA — use the `Threep_` names for now.

## Intent → metric map

| Seller question | Metric ID | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| How much inventory do I have? | `FBA_AVAILABLE_QTY` | Threep_Inventory |
| Am I at risk of stockout? | `FBA_INV_VIS_ONHAND_PMEAN_DOS` (days of supply) | Threep_Inventory |
| What is my demand forecast? | `FBA_FORECAST_N7_P80`, `FBA_FORECAST_N30_P80` | Threep_Inventory |
| When should I restock? | `FBA_INV_VIS_RESTOCK_ORDER_DATE` | Threep_Inventory |
| How much should I restock? | `FBA_INV_RESTOCK_QTY` | Threep_Inventory |
| What is my sales velocity? | `FBA_UNITS_SHIPPED_T30` | Threep_Inventory |
| What is reserved / bound? | `FBA_INV_VIS_BOUND_QTY` | Threep_Inventory |
| What is inbound? | `FBA_INV_INBOUND_TOTAL` | Threep_Inventory |
| How is my traffic? | `SESSION_CNT` | Threep_Traffic |
| What are my page views? | `PAGE_VIEW_CNT` | Threep_Traffic |
| Page views by device? | `DESKTOP_PAGE_VIEW_CNT`, `MOBILE_APPLICATIONS_PAGE_VIEW_CNT`, `MOBILE_BROWSER_PAGE_VIEW_CNT` | Threep_Traffic |
| Am I winning the featured offer? | `FEATURED_OFFER_CNT` | Threep_Traffic |
| How many units did I sell? | `TOTAL_ORDERED_UNITS` | Threep_Sales |
| What is my revenue? | `TOTAL_ORDERED_PROD_SALES_AMT` | Threep_Sales |

## Key metrics by domain

### Threep_Inventory
- **Days of supply / stockout risk:** `FBA_INV_VIS_ONHAND_PMEAN_DOS`, `FBA_INV_VIS_ONHAND_P90_DOS`,
  `FBA_INV_VIS_TOTAL_PMEAN_DOS`, `FBA_INV_VIS_TOTAL_P90_DOS`.
  Analysis rule: **days of supply < 14 → at risk of stockout.**
- **Restock:** `FBA_INV_VIS_RESTOCK_ORDER_DATE` (a `STRING`/date dimension), `FBA_INV_RESTOCK_QTY`,
  `FBA_INV_VIS_RECOMMENDED_MIL_PMEAN_DOS`, `FBA_INV_VIS_RECOMMENDED_MIL_P90_DOS`.
- **On-hand / reserved:** `FBA_AVAILABLE_QTY`, `FBA_INV_VIS_BOUND_QTY`,
  `FBA_INV_VIS_CUSTOMER_ORDERS_QTY`, `FBA_INV_VIS_CUSTOMER_SHIP_DISABLED_QTY`.
- **Inbound / transfers:** `FBA_INV_INBOUND_TOTAL`, `FBA_INV_VIS_TRANS_SHIPMENTS_TOTAL_QUANTITY`.
- **Inventory health:** `FBA_INV_HIL_ZONE`.
- **Sales velocity:** `FBA_UNITS_SHIPPED_T30`.
- **Demand forecast:** `FBA_FORECAST_N7_P80`, `FBA_FORECAST_N30_P80`, `FBA_FORECAST_N60_P80`.

### Threep_Traffic
- **Sessions:** `SESSION_CNT` and device splits `DESKTOP_SESSION_CNT`,
  `MOBILE_APPLICATIONS_SESSION_CNT`, `MOBILE_BROWSER_SESSION_CNT`.
- **Page views:** `PAGE_VIEW_CNT` (+ `DESKTOP_` / `MOBILE_APPLICATIONS_` / `MOBILE_BROWSER_`).
- **Glance views:** `GLANCE_VIEW_CNT` (+ device splits).
- **Featured offer:** `FEATURED_OFFER_CNT` (+ device splits).

### Threep_Sales
- `TOTAL_ORDERED_UNITS`, `TOTAL_ORDERED_ITEMS`, `TOTAL_ORDERED_PROD_SALES_AMT` (revenue —
  include the `currency` field for financial metrics).

## Readiness caveats
- **Metadata is the source of truth for availability.** Not every metric in this catalog is
  exposed to every seller. Use only metrics that appear in the `analytics_getMetricMetadata`
  response — if one isn't returned, don't use it; pick an available alternative and say so.
- Use `analytics_getMetricMetadata` to discover metrics and groupable columns beyond this
  list; this catalog is a curated starting point, not the full set.
